Greetings. :heart_eyes:

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC).

**Past study** I received my Bachelor's degree from the Honors Program of the [Department of Information Technology](https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/vn/), [University of Science](https://hcmus.edu.vn/), [Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City](https://vnuhcm.edu.vn/) (VNU-HCMUS) in Nov 2020. In 2021, I took graduate-level courses from a Master's program at the [John Von Neumann Institute](http://www.jvn.edu.vn/), [Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City](https://vnuhcm.edu.vn/) (JVN) but did not finish the degree.

In my undergraduate years, I was a research assistant at the [Software Engineering Lab](https://www.selab.hcmus.edu.vn/), advised by Professor [Minh-Triet Tran](https://www.fit.hcmus.edu.vn/~tmtriet/). After graduation and before joining UIUC, I was an intern/resident at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/), advised by [Minh-Hoai Nguyen](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~minhhoai/), [Tung Pham](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KcUuEKsAAAAJ&hl=vi), [Viet-Anh Nguyen](http://www.vietanhnguyen.net/), [Nhat Ho](nhatptnk8912.github.io). All of the people mentioned are those to whom I owe a debt of gratitude.

**Research** My main interest is the theoretical aspect of machine learning, especially deep learning, generative models, reinforcement learning, and many other cool things.
